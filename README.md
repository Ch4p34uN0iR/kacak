KACAK
=====

ATTENTION: Most updated version can be accessed using this link http://www.galkan.net/2014/01/enumerate-users-for-windows-based-networks.html

Kacak is a tool that can enumerate users specified in the configuration file for windows based networks. It uses metasploit smb_enumusers_domain module in order to achieve this via msfrpcd service. If you are wondering what the msfrpcd service is, please look at the https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework/blob/master/documentation/msfrpc.txt . It also parse mimikatz results.
At first, install the needed libraries. Please follow the instructions given below;
# apt-get install msgpack-python
# cd /tmp
# wget https://github.com/SpiderLabs/msfrpc/archive/master.zip
# unzip master.zip
# cd msfrpc-master/python-msfrpc
# python setup.py install

Once the installation of libraries were completed, msfrpcd service must be restarted. In order to do this you can use a script which is located in the kacak files named msfrpcd.sh. Prior to this script, check whether the 55552 port number is open or not. Make sure that it is closed.
# netstat -nlput | grep 55552 | grep -v grep     
There are 3 ways of using this script as shown below;
# ./msfrpcd.sh status
  MsfRpcd: Running

# ./msfrpcd.sh stop
  MsfRpcd:  Stopped

#./msfrpcd.sh start
  MsfRpcd:  Starting
  ..................
  MsfRpcd:  Started

And be sure that 55552 port number is open after that. Kacak can be downloaded from https://github.com/galkan/kacak. 

# wget https://github.com/galkan/kacak/archive/master.zip
# unzip master.zip
In order to use kacak properly, you must use 3 files. with one of the files you should specify the user credentials that can login the target ip addresses. Itis xml based file which is shown below named config_file.
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<domain-admin>
         <domain>
                 <name>WORKGROUP</name>
                 <username>Administrator</username>
                 <password>Test123</password>
                <threads>10</threads>
        </domain>
        <domain>
                 <name>Sirket</name>
                 <username>Saldirgan</username>
                 <password>Aa123456</password>
                 <threads>10</threads>
      </domain>
</domain-admin>

Example file which is shown above has 2 users credentials. Each user credentials must be started with and stopped with .

Other file named users_file is used for the users you want to enumarate. It must be like this; "username\domain_name" and If you donâ€™t specify the domain_name, Kacak can't enumarate the users.
Sirket\YoneticiKullanici

Workgroup\Administrator

And the last one is which you want to scan network named ip_file. You can also use cidr notiation.
192.168.100.100
192.168.100.111

ATTENTION: "users_file" and "ip_file" files must HAVE THE full path. Otherwise kacak can't enumarate users properly. Metasploit module needs the full path of these files.

If you have any problem or want to debug with an extra tool, you can use test_kacak.sh which is located in the kacak files.

--mimikatz options is used to parse mimikatz results.
